O-Torii
=======

O-Torii was a ludic-short being made for the A Game By Its Cover 2012 compo.

"Engine", assets, and game was ready. Couldn't get sound to loop (even using the lovely [Buzz.js](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/)), felt that game was dull and boring. Lost interest; gave up before deadline. 

AGAIN.
